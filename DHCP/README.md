# DHCP Overview
All DHCP configuration files will be saved in the directory /etc/dhcp/ and my configuration files will be in this folder. 
# DHCP Install
To install DHCP, run the command sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
(NOTE: you will need internet access.)
# DHCP Configuration
to configure dhcp you have to edit the /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf file using a text editor (I Used Nano)
and if you want to be able to edit and write to the file, you have to sudo the command.
